# Guitar / Ukulele Mount

This part lets you hang a guitar or ukulele for display or during a session.  It's very similar to a String Swing wall mount, but is adaptable to different situations - like clipping to your ukulele to a music stand.

I own several String Swing mounts for guitars, ukuleles, and violins, and was inspired by their great design.  However, I wanted more versitality in where to hang my instruments, while still being confident it would not break.  This design uses larger surfaces to carry the load.  While ukuleles are very lightweight and easy to design for - an electric guitar is much heavier, and requires a different support in the design.

## Rendering

Python is required

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.10

in addition to OpenSCAD (v)

    $ openscad --version
    OpenSCAD version 2018.03.17

Run the python script to generate the .stl files

    $ ./render.py

## Printing

With PLA, use 20% infill, and 3 shells.  This will make a very strong part.

## Finishing

Use a metal file to smooth burs, and remove sharp edges.  The instrument should not touch any sharp edge when placed in the mount, otherwise the instrument could be marked.
